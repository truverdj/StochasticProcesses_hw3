#### (1) Rejection Sampling of the Posterior

I doubt this is correct, but I've been staring at it for hours and can't think of anything else.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\pi(\theta\mid y) 
&= \frac{\pi_0(\theta)L(\theta)}{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\pi_0(\theta)L(\theta)d\theta}\\
&\leq \frac{\pi_0(\theta)\max_\theta L(\theta)}{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\pi_0(\theta)L(\theta)d\theta} \\
&= \frac{\pi_0(\theta)L(\theta_{MLE})}{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\pi_0(\theta)L(\theta)d\theta}
\end{aligned}
$$

Then we use rejection sampling on the unnormalized posterior. 

$$
\pi(\theta\mid y) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\pi_0(\theta)L(\theta)d\theta \leq \pi_0(\theta)L(\theta_{MLE})
$$

That is, the unnormalized density is bounded above by $c$ times the posterior. Rejection sampling should still work since $\pi_0(\theta)$ is a bonafide probability distribution.
